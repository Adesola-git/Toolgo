Wanted to use the abstarct factory class pattern but decided to use factory method pattern not to complicate the creation for now. 
I went with this pattern because currently we are creating a ceiling fan but there maybe a reason to create other type of fan in the future. if i was told to create a different type of fan at the start, depending on the feature, i might have gone with abstract factory.
