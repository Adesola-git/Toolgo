# Ceiling Fan
Programming Language: Java
I wanted to use the abstract factory class pattern but used the factory method pattern to keep the creation simple. 
I went with this pattern because, we are currently creating a ceiling fan, but there may be a reason to create another type of fan. If i was told to create a different type of fan at the start, depending on the feature, i might have gone with the abstract factory.
I added a state field to capture the state of the fan. This might be used to develop other features, like the fan should do nothing if the direction cord is pulled when the fan is off.  

# Tv-Show-Website
Programming Language: React
The website has three pages, including the home page. I used an array to store episodes. This could be derived from the database or a flat file. The community page is where users can post comments about the movie, and there can be some interaction. This page can be improved so users can comment on each other's posts.  Also, comments are not currently stored, the page can be extended to do that.
